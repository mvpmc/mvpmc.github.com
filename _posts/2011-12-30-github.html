<p><span>
The mvpmc project has been moved to <a href="github.com">github</a>, and
split into 2 seperate projects:
</span></p>

<p><span>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/mvpmc">mvpmc</a>
<li><a href="https://github.com/cmyth">cmyth</a>
</ul>
</span></p>

<p><span>
The <b>mvpmc</b> project is the same repository as before, while the
<b>cmyth</b> project is now hosting a standalone copy of libcmyth plus
sample applications.  The reason for doing this is that it will allow
easier collaboration between developers than the previous hosting service,
and it will allow libcmyth to be more easily integrated into other projects.

a repo</a> if you want to get involved.
