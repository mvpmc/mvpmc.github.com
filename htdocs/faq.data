What is the goal of this project?
The goal is to build a media player that runs on the MediaMVP itself,
and fetches media files off standard, external servers.  Currently, it
supports using remote filesystems (NFS and CIFS), digital video recorders
(MythTV and ReplayTV), SlimServer, HTTP, the Hauppauge MediaMVP server,
GBPVR, VLC, Yahoo! Weather, and more.
###

What is the state of mvpmc?
mvpmc is beta software.  You may that features that you want are either
broken or missing.  Please report any bugs or feature requests to the
mailing lists.
###

What do I need to get started?
The easiest thing is to download one of the pre-built dongle.bin
files <a href="index.php?pg=downloads">here</a>.  Then read through
<!--
the <a href="mvpmc-HOWTO-singlehtml.html">HOWTO</a>,
the <a href="windows/mvpmc_windoze_howto.html">Windows HOWTO</a>,
and-->
the <a href="http://mvpmc.wikispaces.com/">Wiki</a>.
###

How do I build mvpmc myself?
In order to build mvpmc from source, you will need a Linux system on
which you can install a cross compilation environment.  You can
get the source either from one of the releases, or from the
<a href="http://git.mvpmc.org/">git repository</a>.
###

How do I build a cross compilation environment?
If you do a build on a system without the cross compiler, it will be
built for you as part of the build.
###

How do I build a new dongle.bin file?
If you download the source release, follow the instructions in
the <b>README</b> file.
###

NFS is hanging.  How do I fix this?
Make sure you use the <b>rsize=4096,wsize=4096</b> options when mounting the
NFS fileystem.  There is a file /etc/nfsmount.sh on the ramdisk that may make
this easier.
###

Why is it trying to tftp a config file?
mvpmc allows you to have a config file on your tftp server so that you
can customize your use of mvpmc to suit your needs.  If the config file
does not exist, mvpmc will start with default options.
This config file is the name of your
dongle.bin bootfile, with .config appended to it (ie, dongle.bin.config).

This config file is a shell script that will be executed as the last step of
booting the MediaMVP.  You should add things here to do whatever setup you
need for your environment.  For example, you might want to set the date, mount
an NFS filesystem, and start mvpmc with whatever options you need.

An example config file might look like:
</span></p><pre>
rdate -s $SERVER
mkdir /video
/etc/nfsmount.sh ${SERVER}:/video /video
mvpmc -s 192.168.1.1 -R discover -c 192.168.1.2 &amp;
</pre><p><span>
###

How do I automatically set the date and time on the MediaMVP?
You will need to ensure that the date and time are set correctly for
some features to work.  Specifically, ReplayTV and live TV with MythTV
will not work if the time is set wrong.

You can either use NTP or rdate to set the time.  If you enable your
DHCP server to provide an NTP address, it will be used.  Otherwise, you
can use either rdate or NTP in your config file like:
</span></p><pre>
rdate -s 192.168.1.1
/bin/ntpclient -d -l -h 192.168.1.1
</pre><p><span>
###

What audio file types are supported?
mvpmc is capable of playing mp3, ogg vorbis, ac3, flac,
and uncompressed WAV files.
It is also capable of playing m3u playlists.
###

What video file types are supported?
mvpmc is capable of playing mpeg1/mpeg2 videos with mpeg or AC3 audio
streams.  In addition, the user can choose the audio stream to play if there
is more than one (ie, a DVD VOB file with multiple language tracks).

For other video types, you can use VLC to transcode to mpeg1/mpeg2.
###

What image file types are supported?
mvpmc is capable of displaying bmp, gif, png, and jpeg images.
###

Can I play a DVD movie?
You should be able to play individual VOB files from a DVD, but there is no
support for DVD menus at this time.  However, you will probably run into
audio synchronization problems with Dolby Digital audio.
###

What is wrong with the DVD subtitles?
The current DVD subtitle support allows the subtitles to be displayed,
but neither at the correct time nor for the correct duration.
###

How do I select my preferred language track in an MPEG?
Currently, the audio, video, and subtitle streams are referred to by
their hex stream ID.  For DVD .VOB files, the information about which
track goes with which language is not in the MPEG itself, so mvpmc is
unable to give useful names to each stream.
###

Why do I not hear any audio when I start playing a video?
This is often caused by a mvpmc choosing to play a silent audio track
over one with sound.  Try using the <b>MENU</b> key and changing the audio
stream in the audio stream menu.
###

How do I connect to a MythTV server?
Use mvpmc with the -s flag to specify the IP address of the MythTV server.  If
you also use the -r flag to specify the NFS mount point of the MythTV
recordings directory, then you will play your MythTV recordings via NFS
(If you have multiple backends, use -r with a colon-seperated list for each
directory in which to look for recordings).  If
not, you will play them via the Myth protocol.
###

What version of MythTV does mvpmc support?
mvpmc 0.3.4 supports MythTV 0.14 through 0.20 (plus SVN versions beyond 0.20).
###

Why is MythTV complaining "Client speaks protocol version 8 but we speak 15!"?
This is because MythTV itself only ever supports one protocol version at a
time, while mvpmc tries to be compatible with all versions of MythTV.  So
mvpmc starts with protocol 8, and MythTV will tell it what protocol version
it should be speaking, and mvpmc will then switch to the correct version.
###

How well does mvpmc work as a MythTV frontend?
mvpmc is not a complete replacement for the MythTV frontend that comes with
MythTV.  However, it is capable of doing most of the things that a typical
user will do on a day-to-day basis.
###

How do I delete a MythTV recording?
Use the <b>MENU</b> key when the recording is highlighted to bring up the episode
menu.  From there you can either delete the recording, or delete it while
allowing future recordings.
###

How come I get a blank screen when I attempt to play my MythTV recordings?
You are probably transcoding your recordings to a format that the MediaMVP
is not capable of playing.  Your recordings need to be in mpeg1/mpeg2 format.
If your recordings are in some other video format, you can set up VLC to
transcode them to mpeg1/mpeg2 on the fly for mvpmc.
###

How do I watch live TV off a MythTV server?
Live TV changed quite drastically in MythTV 0.19.  However, mvpmc is
capable of playing live TV from both older and newer backends.

You can watch live TV either via the filesystem or the myth protocol.  If you
use the -b option to mvpmc, you can tell mvpmc which directory contains the
ringbuffer.  If you do not use the -b option, then live tv will be played
via the myth protocol.

When you select live TV, you will be given a menu containing all of the
programs currently being broadcast.  If you choose one of the programs, it
will attempt to start playing it on any of the tuners where that program
is available.  If you use the <b>MENU</b> button, you will get a menu that
will allow you to choose which tuner you want to watch the program on.
###

Why do I only get a single, empty live TV program listing with MythTV?
This is probably because you have not set the date properly on the mvp.
###

How do I connect to a ReplayTV/DVArchive?
You need to specify either the IP address of your ReplayTV/DVArchive server 
or tell mvpmc to run replaytv discovery via the -R option.
The -R option accepts a parameter string as follows:
</span></p><pre>
A single IP address can be specified or discovery enabled as follows:
   mvpmc -R 192.168.1.10
   mvpmc -R discover
&nbsp;
Multiple options can be specified by passing in a quoted string.
&nbsp;
The following options are supported:
   ip=ipaddress1/ipaddress2/ipaddress3/...
   ip=discover
   debug=tracemask
   logfile=nfsmount-logfile-path
&nbsp;
examples:
   mvpmc -R "ip=192.168.1.10"
   mvpmc -R "ip=192.168.1.10/192.168.1.11"
   mvpmc -R "ip=discover debug=05"
   mvpmc -R "ip=192.168.1.10 debug=0ff logfile=/nfs/mvplogs"
</pre><p><span>
###

How does the music client work?
The music client connects to
<a href="http://www.slimdevices.com/su_downloads.html">SlimServer</a>, which
is an audio server that is capable of playing audio files off a server, or
connecting to Internet radio sites.  Run mvpmc using the -c option with the
IP address of your server.
###

What keys do what on the remote control?
When in the menus, up and down move the hilite up and down, and the red and
yellow buttons are page up and page down, respectively.  Also, the OK button
will select the hilited item, and the BACK/EXIT button will return you to the
previous screen.

While playing a video, the MUTE button will mute the audio.  The FULL button
will zoom the image.  The PAUSE button will pause playback.  The STOP button
will return you to the file/MythTV/ReplayTV menu.
The MENU button
will display the video popup menu.  The REPLAY and SKIP buttons will perform
30 second skip backwards and forwards, respectively.  The number buttons will
jump to a percentage offset into the file (ie, 6 is 60% into the file).
And finally, the unlabled button next to MUTE will bring up the On Screen
Display.
###

How can I change the interface colors?
You will find a few XML files in /usr/share/mvpmc when you boot the mvp.
If you use the -t option to mvpmc to point to one of these files, you will
get a different interface.  You can also easily modify these files to suit
your tastes.  You can change the fonts, the colors, and some simple widget
decorations for most of the widgets.
###

Can I override the fonts in one of the default themes?
Yes.  Add something like the following to your config file:

</span></p><pre>
cat &lt;&lt;EOF &gt; /tmp/font_override.xml
&lt;mvpmctheme version="0" name="font override"&gt;
	&lt;font name="standard"&gt;/etc/helvB18.pcf&lt;/font&gt;
	&lt;font name="large"&gt;/etc/helvB18.pcf&lt;/font&gt;
&lt;/mvpmctheme&gt;
EOF
</pre><p><span>
###

Can I override widget settings in one of the default themes?
Yes.  Add your settings to the file /tmp/user_override.xml.
###

How do I add my own themes?
Any xml theme file added to /tmp/themes will be picked up by mvpmc and
added to the theme menu.  If you use the -t option to mvpmc, it will start
with that theme.  Otherwise, it will start with the default theme, and you
will be able to change the theme from the theme menu.
