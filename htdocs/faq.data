What is the goal of this project?
The goal is to build a media player that runs on the MediaMVP itself,
and fetches media files off standard, external servers.  Currently, it
supports using NFS, MythTV, or ReplayTV (with caveats, of course).
###

What is the state of mvpmc?
mvpmc is alpha software.  Some things work, some things do not.
Please do not be surprised if things do not work as well as you want,
and please report bugs and missing functionality as you find them.
###

What do I need to get started?
In order to build mvpmc from source, you will need a Linux system on
which you can install a cross compilation environment.  If you do not
have this, you can still build the binary release as long as you have
an x86 Linux system on which to run the build script.

Once you create your dongle.bin, you will want to set up a tftpboot
server, and some sort of media server.  This could be as simple as an
NFS filesystem, or as complicated as a MythTV backend.

You will then need a DHCP server and a tftp server to allow the MediaMVP
to boot.
###

How do I build a cross compilation environment?
To build a uClibc cross compilation environment, you should download
<a class=redlink href="dl/mvpmc_toolchain.tar.gz">this</a> tarball and run the
<b>mvpmc-uclibc.sh</b> script.
###

Should I use glibc or uClibc?
Functionally, there should be no difference between mvpmc built
against glibc and uClibc.  The difference is size.  The uClibc based
ramdisk will be around 1MB smaller than a glibc based ramdisk.  And on the
MediaMVP, that is a big difference.
###

How do I build a new dongle.bin file?
There is a build script in both the binary and source releases called
dongle_build.sh.  You pass it a Hauppauge supplied dongle.bin file, and it
will extract the IBM kernel modules, and build a new dongle.bin based on a
supplied linux kernel and ramdisk filesystem.
###

NFS is hanging.  How do I fix this?
Make sure you use the <b>rsize=4096,wsize=4096</b> options when mounting the
NFS fileystem.  There is a file /etc/nfsmount.sh on the ramdisk that may make
this easier.
###

Why is it trying to tftp a config file?
The default init scripts do not start mvpmc.  Instead they try and tftp a
config file from your tftp server.  This allows you to modify your use of
mvpmc without rebuilding the dongle.bin file.  It also allows you to easily
have different configurations for different MediaMVPs in your network.
This config file is the name of your
dongle.bin bootfile, with .config appended to it (ie, dongle.bin.config).

This config file is a shell script that will be executed as the last step of
booting the MediaMVP.  You should add things here to do whatever setup you
need for your environment.  For example, you might want to set the date, mount
an NFS filesystem, and start mvpmc with whatever options you need.

An example config file might look like:
</p><pre>
rdate -s $SERVER
mkdir /video
/etc/nfsmount.sh ${SERVER}:/video /video
mvpmc -f /etc/helvR10.fnt -s 192.168.1.15 &
</pre><p>

###

What audio file types are supported?
mvpmc is capable of playing mp3, ac3, and uncompressed WAV files.  At this
time, audio support in mvpmc is quite weak.  It can play audio files, but does
not allow you to seek in them, and does not support playlists.
###

What video file types are supported?
mvpmc is capable of playing mpeg1/mpeg2 videos with mpeg or AC3 audio
streams.  In addition, the user can choose the audio stream to play if there
is more than one (ie, a DVD VOB file with multiple language tracks).
###

What image file types are supported?
mvpmc is capable of displaying bmp, gif, png, and jpeg images.  At this time,
image support in mvpmc is quite weak.  There is no support for scaling images
to fit on the screen, for example.
###

Can I play a DVD movie?
You should be able to play individual VOB files from a DVD, but there is no
support for DVD menus at this time.  However, you will probably run into
audio synchronization problems with Dolby Digital audio.
###

What is wrong with the DVD subtitles?
The current DVD subtitle support allows the subtitles to be displayed,
but neither at the correct time nor for the correct duration.
###

How do I select my preferred language track in an MPEG?
Currently, the audio, video, and subtitle streams are referred to by
their hex stream ID.  For DVD .VOB files, the information about which
track goes with which language is not in the MPEG itself, so mvpmc is
unable to give useful names to each stream.
###

How do I connect to a MythTV server?
Use mvpmc with the -s flag to specify the IP address of the MythTV server.  If
you also use the -r flag to specify the NFS mount point of the MythTV
recordings directory, then you will play your MythTV recordings via NFS.  If
not, you will play them via the Myth protocol.
###

How well does mvpmc work as a MythTV frontend?
You can watch and delete your recordings, as well as view the upcoming
recording schedule.  Additional functionality, such as scheduling of
recordings, commercial skip, etc are not supported at this time.
###

How do I delete a MythTV recording?
Use the MENU key when the recording is highlighted to bring up the episode
menu.  From there you can either delete the recording, or delete it while
allowing future recordings.
###

How come I get a blank screen when I attempt to play my MythTV recordings?
You are probably transcoding your recordings to a format that the MediaMVP
is not capable of playing.  Your recordings need to be in mpeg1/mpeg2 format.
###

How do I watch live TV off a MythTV server?
It does not work well, but you can use the -b option to point mvpmc to the
directory containing your ringbuffer.  You can change channels with the
channel up/down buttons, but you then need to return to the beginning of
the file to start watching the new channel (with the '0' button).
###

How do I connect to a ReplayTV/DVArchive?
You need to specify either the IP address of your ReplayTV/DVArchive server 
or tell mvpmc to run replaytv discovery via the -R option.
The -R option accepts a parameter string as follows:
</p><pre>
A single IP address can be specified or discovery enabled as follows:
   mvpmc -R 192.168.1.10
   mvpmc -R discover
Multiple options can be specified by passing in a quoted string.
The following options are supported:
   ip=ipaddress1/ipaddress2/ipaddress3/...
   ip=discover
   debug=tracemask
   logfile=nfsmount-logfile-path
examples:
   mvpmc -R "ip=192.168.1.10"
   mvpmc -R "ip=192.168.1.10/192.168.1.11"
   mvpmc -R "ip=discover debug=05"
   mvpmc -R "ip=192.168.1.10 debug=0ff logfile=/nfs/mvplogs"
</pre><p>
###

What keys do what on the remote control?
When in the menus, up and down move the hilite up and down, and the red and
yellow buttons are page up and page down, respectively.  Also, the OK button
will select the hilited item, and the BACK/EXIT button will return you to the
previous screen.

While playing a video, the MUTE button will mute the audio.  The FULL button
will zoom the image.  The PAUSE button will pause playback.  The STOP button
will return you to the file/MythTV/ReplayTV menu.
The MENU button
will display the video popup menu.  The REPLAY and SKIP buttons will perform
30 second skip backwards and forwards, respectively.  The number buttons will
jump to a percentage offset into the file (ie, 6 is 60% into the file).
And finally, the unlabled button next to MUTE will bring up the On Screen
Display.
###

Why won't my image display properly?
Image support is currently quite poor.  Some jpeg images, for example, will
not display at all.  If you find your jpeg images will not display,
reducing their size may help.
