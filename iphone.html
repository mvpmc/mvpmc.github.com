    mvpmc is available from the Apple iTunes store as mvpmc 0.1.8.  It will
    run on an iPhone or iPod Touch (and presumably an iPad).  This first
    release is very basic, and is more of a proof-of-concept than anything
    else.  It will allow you to watch your MythTV recordings and initiate
    a transcode via VLC to a format that is playable on the iPhone.
  </p>

  <p>
    In order to use it, you will need a <a href="http://www.mythtv.org/">
    MythTV</a>, and probably <a href="http://www.videolan.org/">VLC</a> and
    a web server.  And your VLC installation will need to be capable of
    encoding AAC audio, which will likely mean that you will need to either
    build it yourself, or get it from somewhere like
    <a href="http://www.medibuntu.org/">medibuntu</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    If your MythTV recordings are playable directly on the iPhone, then you
    do not need to do any transcoding.  You can simply play the original
    file and ignore the settings for VLC and the web server.
  </p>

  <p>
    In order to initiate a transcode from the iPhone,
    you will need to start VLC with the <i>-I telnet</i> option.  This will
    allow mvpmc to control the transcoding of your MythTV recordings.
  </p>

  <p>
    In order to view your transcoded files, you will need a web server
    capable of serving them to your phone.
